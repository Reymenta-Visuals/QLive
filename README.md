Fix this
QLive::parseDeviceParam( osc::Message message )
line #439

LiveGui: 

    - volume and param slider don't get set properly
    - implement even handlers
    - update gui on msg received
    - params values must be updated with the value ref, the current solution goes in conflicts because osc runs in a thread. the gui often override ableton(try to move the knobs)
